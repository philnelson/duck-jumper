# Before you ask

Yep, I will respond to [Issues](https://github.com/philnelson/duck-jumper/issues) and [Pull requests](https://github.com/philnelson/duck-jumper/pulls).

# What is this

Duck Jumper (AKA as "Cyber Fowl Hopper" in parts of Europe, and simply "Jump!! With Duck" in Japan) was originally released in February 1987 for the EXTRAGAME 20-in-1 home console. Due to extremely limited graphics, sound, and game play it was taken off of the market in March 1987 and promptly disposed of in a Wyoming landfill.

# How to run

Currently you'll need the `love2d` runtime. Go to [love2d.org][1] and download the package for your particular system. Double-click `duck.love` to run the game.
